# HealthCare Analysis (2019 - 2024)

## 📘 Introduction

This Power BI dashboard provides an overview of healthcare data, including metrics related to hospitals, patients, medical conditions, admission types, blood types, gender demographics, and insurance providers. The goal is to support healthcare management with data-driven insights for effective decision-making.

## 🧠 Problem Solved

The analysis focuses on:

1. **Patient Demographics**
   - Gender distribution (Female, Male, Non-binary)
   - Blood type prevalence
   - Patient condition status (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive)

2. **Medical Conditions**
   - Breakdown of common conditions (e.g., Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, Arthritis, Cancer, Asthma)
   - Distribution across different gender categories

3. **Admission Types**
   - Categorization into Emergency, Elective, and Urgent admissions
   - Helps assess patient flow and hospital readiness

4. **Insurance Coverage**
   - Patient counts per insurance provider (e.g., Medicare, Aetna, United, Cigna)
   - Insights into health coverage utilization

5. **Healthcare Resource Metrics**
   - Total number of hospitals and doctors
   - Count of medical conditions treated
   - Total treatment cost incurred

6. **Time-Based Patient Trends**
   - Yearly admission trends (2020–2024)
   - Useful for evaluating growth or decline in patient admissions over time



## 🧠 Purpose of the Analysis

- Identify high-risk health conditions and their demographic patterns
- Support healthcare resource allocation (doctors, blood types, insurance)
- Enable data-driven decision-making for improved patient care
- Highlight gaps or anomalies, such as sudden drops in admission rates

## 📈 Key Insights

1. **Gender Distribution**
   - Female - 50%, Male - 40%, Non-binary - 10%
   - Female patients make up the majority across most medical conditions.
   - Non-binary representation is included, showing inclusivity in data collection.

3. **Medical Conditions**  
   - Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity are the most common conditions among patients.
  
4. **Patient Admission Types**  
   - Emergency admissions constitute a significant portion, indicating a need for enhanced urgent care preparedness.
   - Elective and Urgent admissions are nearly equal, suggesting balanced scheduling and demand.

5. **Insurance Provider Coverage**  
   - Medicare holds the highest number of insured patients.
   - Other providers like United and Cigna also contribute significantly, implying a diverse insurance landscape.

6. **Blood Type Distribution**  
   - A+ is the most common blood type among patients, followed by O+ and O-.
   - Rarer blood types (e.g., AB-) are present in smaller numbers, which may impact emergency preparedness for transfusions.

7. **Patient Condition Status**  
   - A high percentage of patients (55%) are marked as having abnormal conditions.
   - A notable portion (35%) is labeled as inconclusive, suggesting room for improved diagnostics or data quality.

8. **Healthcare Resource Utilization**  
   - A total of 10 hospitals and 40K doctors are handling 56K patients.
   - Total treatment costs reach approximately **1.42 billion**, indicating significant healthcare expenditure.

9. **Admission Trends Over Time**  
   - Patient admissions have varied across the years 2020–2024, showing fluctuating demand that may be tied to external factors like pandemics or policy changes.
